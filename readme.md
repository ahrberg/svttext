# SVT Text CLI

Read Swedish news from SVT Text in the terminal. Fetching and parsing directly from https://www.svt.se/text-tv.

**Work in progress. Compile and run as you like at moment using the go cli**

## TODO

- [ ] Colorize output, add flag `--color`
- [ ] Interactive mode, add a flag `--interactive` and don't exit the cli instead give options like enter new page, navigate with arrow keys, vi key binding etc.
- [ ] Add SVT logo? The "TV" version have a logo at the start page. Maybe add this as ascii art?
